# 50 DAYS OF PYTHON

This challenge is based on the book with same name by Benjamin Bennett Alexander.

The purpose of running this challenge is to do a quick refresher course on my python fundamentals.

This note will be updated upon completion of the challenge with valuable insights and takeaways from the challenge.

ChatGPT and StackOverflow are not allowed. I have instead chosen to read up concepts from docs and/or tutorials from GeeksForGeeks, w3schools et al.

See you on Day 50.
